        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Gricia (pronounced GREE-cha) is often described as a "white amatriciana," or "carbonara without eggs," definitions that relate it to its better known Roman siblings. Neither of those explanations is blatantly wrong, but they don't give gricia the credit it deserves.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Guanciale</li>
            <li>Rigatoni</li>
            <li>Pecorino Romano</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Steps</h4>

            <li>
                Cut and Cook the Guanciale
                I start by popping the guanciale in the freezer for a few minutes. Like bacon and pancetta, chilled or frozen guanciale is much easier to slice into lardons. Once the guanciale is all cut up, I cook it in a large stainless steel skillet with a touch of olive oil over medium-low heat until most of the fat has rendered and the pieces are golden brown and crispy. I then remove the guanciale pieces from the skillet with a slotted spoon and set them aside, leaving the rendered fat in the skillet.
                Removing the cooked guanciale at this stage allows us to control its texture in the finished dish, and makes it easier to build a stable emolsified sauce. Leaving the guanciale in the pan for the entire process would make it limp and soft, instead of that sweet spot between crisp and tender (more on that later). Whatever you do, please don't discard any of that beautiful rendered guanciale fat. All you'll be doing is throwing away money and flavor. This isn't health food, and that's okay. You can eat a kale salad tomorrow.

                Bloom the Pepper
                Once the guanciale is out, I reduce the heat to low and grind a healthy amount of black pepper into the warm guanciale fat. I find measuring freshly ground pepper to be a hassle, so when I say that you want about a teaspoon of pepper, that's an eyeball measurement. If you want to crack a bunch of pepper into a ramekin to then measure it out, go for it. Once the pepper is in the skillet, I swirl it around until it begins to foam and release its floral aroma.

                Cook the Pasta Halfway
                While the guanciale is crisping, I bring three quarts of water to a boil in a pot. Cooking pasta in a smaller amount of water results in starchier water, and for gricia, we are all about that starch. Not only will we be cooking the pasta with less water, but we will also be pulling it from that water early and finishing it for an extended period in the skillet, adding reserved pasta water to help it cook the rest of the way.
                We therefore need to adjust our approach to seasoning the pasta water with salt, since we'll be reducing a large amount of that pasta water into the sauce. Keep in mind that the other main elements of the dish—guanciale and Pecorino Romano—are on the saltier side as well. A couple of teaspoons of kosher salt for three quarts of water is plenty. Once the water is seasoned, I add the rigatoni to the pot, set a timer for five minutes, and stir frequently for the first minute to prevent the pasta from sticking.
                For this recipe, I only use 12 ounces of dry pasta, as it's a heavy dish, and that is more than enough for four servings. This amount of pasta also ensures that we won't be overcrowding the skillet for the second stage of pasta cooking.
                While the pasta cooks, I set a colander inside a large bowl, and place them in the kitchen sink. Right before the timer goes off, I use a large liquid measuring cup to scoop out two cups of pasta water, and transfer it to the skillet, which I return to high heat, bringing the mixture of pasta water and guanciale fat to a rapid boil to emulsify it. I drain the pasta in the prepared bowl, reserving the rest of the pasta water for later, and then add the rigatoni to the skillet.
            </li>
            <li> Glazed Over
Once the pasta's in the skillet, we're halfway there. Because the pasta is only cooked for five minutes in the pot, we'll need to finish it in the skillet. During this stage, it is important to keep the contents of the skillet constantly swirling around—we're simultaneously cooking the pasta, building the sauce emulsion, and glazing the rigatoni in that emulsion, as you would for a side of glazed carrots.

This is a great time to test out your skillet-wrist-flick-toss skills. If you don't feel confident with that technique, don't fret. You can simply swirl the pan, and use a spoon (not tongs, please, as they can mangle the pasta) to rapidly stir the pasta. The beauty of cooking the pasta in this way is that the rigatoni will continue to leach starch into the sauce, strengthening the emulsion, while the sauce stains and coats the noodles. It's a reciprocal give-and-take relationship.

This method also extends the cooking time window for perfectly al dente pasta, a phenomenon that Daniel calls Pasta Bullet Time. You want the sauce to be thickened, fully emulsified, and just pooling at the edges of the skillet. If the sauce begins to over-reduce before the pasta has finished cooking, all you need to do is add a little more pasta water to the skillet, and just keep swirling. Just before the pasta reaches a perfect al dente, I return the guanciale to the skillet and toss it to combine. This brief time in the skillet allows the pork to heat through and soften ever so slightly, giving us that perfect crispy-chewy balance.

<li> Make It Rain Cheese
I then finish the pasta off-heat, so that the addition (or additions to be precise) of Pecorino doesn't break the emulsion. I start by adding half the grated Pecorino, tossing and stirring everything together until the cheese is fully incorporated. I then go in with the remaining grated cheese, and repeat the tossing step to fully incorporate and melt the Pecorino. Adding the cheese in two stages prevents it from clumping and ruining the perfect gricia that we've so carefully constructed.
